I have made you a Bot capable of downloading videos and Photos from Instagram, Pinterest and Youtube

As of January 2024 I am a Student at Galgotias University pursuing my BCA.

The motive of creating this bot was to challenge my coding skills and the challenge was tough i won't lie.

I learnt some things and have some features which can be implemented to upgrade this bot functionality.

*My Linkedin Profile* &nbsp;[LinkedIN](www.linkedin.com/in/prithvi-srivastava-a974092a6).

# &nbsp; Introduction

This bot is built upon selenium and pytube which powers its core mechanism i also used asynchronous function. The bot is built on pure python

It\'s compatible
with Python versions **3.8+**.


## &nbsp; Note

Although It took me 6 hours to code this bot from scratch but it is still not production ready i'll add some features which i think will help this bot move to the next level, do create a pull request if you have some too
# &nbsp; Installing

You can install and run this bot as via

``` shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Prithvi824/Telegram-Download-Bot.git
$ cd Telegram-Download-Bot
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## &nbsp; Dependencies & Their Versions

Everything and anything this bot might need is in the **requirements.txt**

# &nbsp; Quick Start

After Installing to start the bot you can use the following commands
```shell
$ cd "FTL Bot"
$ echo Token=YOUR_TOKEN > .env
$ python main.py
```

Replace the **YOUR_TOKEN** with the token of your telegram bot.
If you don;t have one create a token using the father bot in telegram.

# &nbsp; Contributing

**If you want to contribute here's what you can do:**

```
-> Using multiple threads to increase the download speed
-> Adding Download Functionality to Reddit and twitch
-> Adding Comments to let others know what it is doing
-> Adding some sense to generating names
-> Adding more features like retriving captions of a post
-> Adding a function to download profile photo of Instagram
```

**If you have some ideas of your own feel free to implement them and push it**


**This bot is not much but we all starts somewhere**
